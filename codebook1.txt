Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the Accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, tBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, tBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

From the original set of variables that were estimated from these signals those two were selected: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
timeBodyAccelerometerMean
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean
timeBodyGyroscopeMean
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean

The dataset incluses a two additional variables: "subject" and "activity" that allow you to see the values of the variables for each person in each activity.

From the tidy dataset  i created a second, independent tidy data setcalled Data2 with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
